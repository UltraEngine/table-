# Table++

By Josh Klint https://www.ultraengine.com

This code is meant to bridge the gaps between dynamic data in C++, JSON files, and Lua.

The tables can be accessed by Lua with the sol binding library, but the tables themselves do not use Lua.

This is useful for dynamic application settings and user-defined settings added by script.
