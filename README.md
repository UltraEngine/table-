## About

This code is meant to bridge the gaps between dynamic data in C++, Lua, and JSON.

The tables can be accessed by Lua using the [sol](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) library, but the tables themselves do not use Lua.

This is useful for dynamic application settings and user-defined settings added by script.
